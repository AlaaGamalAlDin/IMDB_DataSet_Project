# IMDB_DataSet_Project


# Analyze Dependencies:

The grading rubric asked to inspect relationships between multiple variables. We had to include one dependent variable and three independent variables in our investigation. We had to compute relevant statistics throughout the analysis when making inferences about the data. So, we got to use all the techniques learned in the previous modules



# Use NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib:

The chief aim of this assignment was to demonstrate our knowledge and application of NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib. We had to display our skills in using vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas;  familiarity with Pandasâ€™ Series and DataFrame objects and ability to call on Matplotlib functions to make plots showcasing our findings



# Create Visualizations:

The evaluation criteria was to incorporate appropriate visualizations of our Summary statistics. We also had to present varied plots and multiple comparisons and trends. (minimum two) But the goal was to master depicting data such that it effectively communicated the results of our analysis and allowed easy interpretation.
